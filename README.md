## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at doing a significant responsive design challenge and figuring out how to get the image to display in an acceptable way was a bit difficult. In the end I was able to solve this issue by using flexbox and flex basis which gave me a suitable outcome.

### Continued development

I need to continue practising responsive design and gain more experience and knowledge in that particular area as well as continue to develop my skills with Tailwind CSS.
